# Bike Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of bike purchases to identify factors influencing sales, including demographics, income, and commute distance. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Excel Project Dataset.xlsx" file, which contains detailed information about each bike purchase made by customers. This dataset consists of a thousand unique customers and their purchasing data, along with key customer background data. 

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Excel - Data Analysis
- Excel - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks: 
1. Data loading/Inspection
2. Handling Missing data using filters and find and replace functions
3. Removing Duplicates
4. Data Type Conversion/Standardization, e.g converting income data type from text to currency, using "male" and "female" text descriptors
5. Error Correction using conditional formatting and IF statements.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the bike sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What's the average income of bike buyers vs. non-buyers, regionally? (Income comparison)
- How does the bike purchase rate change with commute distance? (Commute impact)
- Which regions have the highest/lowest bike purchase proportions? (Regional performance)
- Which demographic segments (marital status, education, age) buy bikes most/least? (Customer segments)
- Is there a link between regional income level and bike purchase rate? (Regional wealth vs. sales)
